### About this project
--------

***Kotlin project*** is a project that was designed to work out 
of the box using Gradle build system from day one.  The creation of

possibility of as many software attacks as posable.

- Gradle as the tool for managing and packaging.
- Setup with Travis-ci.
- Simple project structure just for you.
